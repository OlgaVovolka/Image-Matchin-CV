# Satellite Image Matching Project

## Project Description
This project involves processing and analyzing satellite imagery to find matches between different images. It uses computer vision techniques, particularly feature extraction and feature matching, to identify similarities and differences across satellite images. The project is valuable for applications such as change detection, environmental monitoring, and geographical analysis.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python installed on your system along with several dependencies.

### Dependencies
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
3. **Install required Python libraries:**

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Preprocess Images**: Standardize the satellite images by resizing and converting them to grayscale.
2. **Extract Features**: Use SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) to extract features from each image.
3. **Match Features**: Compare features between different images to find matches.
4. **Visualize Matches**: Draw matches on the images for visual inspection and verification.
